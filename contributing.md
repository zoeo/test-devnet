# How to contribute

For sample code, you can help in these primary ways:
 - Testing the Learning Lab and then reporting issues in the repo or in the common issues tracking repo
 - Using the Issue tracker to report issues or comment that you will work on an issue
 - Updating the sample code
 - If needed, updating the content in the Learning Lab repo
 - If needed, requesting or creating a release for the Learning Lab
 - If needed, contacting DevNet to publish new or updated Learning Labs

## Using the issue tracker

For DevNet Express events, use these issue tracker repos based on the content track:
* https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/devnet-express-dna-issues
* https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/devnet-express-cc-issues
* https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/devnet-express-dci-issues
* https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/devnet-express-security-issues

Use the issue tracker to suggest additions, report bugs, and ask questions.
This is also a great way to connect with the developers of the project and find others interested in this solution.

Also use the issue tracker to find ways to contribute. Test a lab, find a bug,
log an issue, or offer an update, comment on the issue that you will take on
that effort, then follow the _Changing the samples_ guidance below.

## Changing the examples

Generally speaking, you should clone the repository, make changes locally, and then submit a pull request (PR). We expect you have validated that all code samples work as expected. Plus, the code should follow pep8 guidelines for Python.
